# Craft 5 Kitchen Sink

A Craft CMS 5 project with a focus on demonstrating various field types and settings.

Created as part of a master's thesis on content modeling in the context of various content management systems, especially field types/complex content types and their settings as building blocks for content modeling and a smooth authoring experience.

May also serve as presentation material for Craft CMS 5, showcasing the capabilities of the system to clients.

Inspired by the kitchen sink example in [Kirby 5 playground](https://github.com/wsydney76/kirby5-playground).

## DDEV Installation

* Clone repository
* `cd` into project directory
* Run `bash setup/install <projectname> <username> <password>` (or follow the included steps manually)

Optionally run `ddev craft db/restore setup/seed.sql.zip` to seed the project with example (nonsense) content.
